    <a href="http://isis.apache.org" target="_blank">Apache Isis</a>&trade; is a platform to let you rapidly develop
    domain-driven apps in Java.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The Creation Tool Prototype demonstrates how a maritime ontology and taxonomy is used to make consistent machine-readable regulations to support compliance and enforcement.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This prototype is based on the Isis Addons' <a href="https://github.com/isisaddons/isis-wicket-summernote" target="_blank">Summernote Editor (Wicket) component</a>,
    configured for a very simple and purposefully minimal application.
    <br/>
